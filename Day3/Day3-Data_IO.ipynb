    "\n",
    "## Data and File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading in data and making it accessible to your data science techniques is the first step in data science success. This is called data loading or sometimes parsing. As a data scientists you may not have complete control over the format of your data when you first start a project. So it is part of your job to find a way to load it and parse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is a simple, text-based format that stores tabular data. Each line in the file represents a data record (a row), and each record consists of one or more fields (columns) separated by commas. The data does not have types and is read in as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text - General**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a generalization of CSV types where the data could be just written to lines, or stored as a single string. Once this is read in you would need to do a lot of work to parse it and turn it in to data. It is extremely inefficient, but sometimes this is how the data comes to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "JSON is a text-based format for representing semi-structured data using key-value pairs, similar to Python dictionaries. It's great for data that has a nested or hierarchical structure. It is human readable but less efficient for storing large flat tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Apache Parquet**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parquet is a binary, columnar storage format. Instead of storing data row-by-row like a CSV, it stores all the values for a single column together. This structure is highly optimized for analytical queries. This format can make it really fast to read in subsets of the data and allows for compression of the data. It is not human readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pickle**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickle is a Python-specific binary format used for serializing and de-serializing Python objects. It can turn almost any Python object (like a list, a dictionary, or even a trained machine learning model) into a stream of bytes that can be saved to a file. It can handle very complex python objects and is extremely easy to use. Can have some compatibility and security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5)**\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 is a high-performance binary format designed to store and organize massive amounts of data. It acts like a file system within a single file, allowing you to store multiple datasets (e.g., arrays, tables) in a hierarchical structure. It is great for large,complex scientific datasets, but has a steep learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geospatial Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data are typically categorized as either vector (representing features with points, lines, and polygons) or raster (representing features as a grid of pixels or cells). There are many formats for these files. One popular one is GeoJSON - which leverages the JSON file format but allows for vector based data. GeoTIFF is standard for raster data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web APIs (Application Programming Interface) - not a data type but a data access type**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many websites have public APIs providing data feeds via one of the formats above. If a website has an API , you should use this interface to get data rather than trying to scrape the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Databases - again not a data type**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases data can be stored in a database: SQL server, MySQL, NoSQL Mongo, or Graph Databases. In these cases you *query* the database to get access to subsets of the data. The choice of database is highly dependent on the project needs and scalability. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Data Loading Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this class will focus on using Pandas for our data management. NOTE: if you are a geospatial student there is a sister package called GeoPandas that has very similar functionality to Pandas.\n",

    "- *Indexing* These arguments help you choose which columns or rows are returned in the DataFrame, and whether or not to get column or index names from the data set.\n",

    "- *Date and time parsing* These arguments help you combine date and time information spread over multiple columns into a single column in the result.\n",
    "- *Iterating* Useful for very large files - you can load in chunks.\n",
    "- *Unclean data issues* These arguments allow you to skip over header or footer rows, or tell Pandas what to do with comments or numbers that are split by commas.\n",
